# Marvel App

This is a project for me to learn React Native.
It is using React Native with Expo and TypeScript.

The goal is to build an app for viewing Marvel characters.
These will be provided by the Marvel API.

## Development

Start the local server with `npm start`. From there, connect via the Expo Go
apps.
